# Financial_Econometrics_FRED

Analyzing Federal Reserve Economic Data.

The Financial Econometrics file consits of a MATLAB function that has as output:

a) OLS estimator;
b) confidence intervals;
c) statistical significance;
d) Rsquared and Adjusted Rsquared;
e) F-statistic;
f) plot of the fitted model;
g) Diagnostic tests for residuals (normality, heteroscedasticity, serial correlation); h) multicollinearity.

I used the function above to estimate a linear model.

The linear model I estimated was...

Personal Consumption Expenditures = 𝛃0 + 𝛃1 Food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption + 𝛃2 Healthcare + 𝜺
     
Personal Consumption Expenditure is all the spending on goods or services to satisfy the household's needs and wants. I want to test how eating out and healthcare costs in the US affect personal consumption. Is eating out correlated with healthcare costs? 

The forecastingARIMA file, ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting.

Using the FRED data I made an ARIMA model for The US Exports and Imports.
